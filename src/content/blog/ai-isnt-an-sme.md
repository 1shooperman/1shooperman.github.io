title: AI isn't a subject matter expert...?

excerpt: We still need humans who can review the code.

On the hour long round trip driving my eldest to high school, I was trying to explain why a career as a software developer might not be as stable as it used to be. While I was turning that into a coherent story, a bunch of small learnings from the past year coalesced into one point.

AI is replacing the act of writing code. I use it the way I use an electric driver to turn a screw: because it's more efficient. What today's tools still don't do reliably is answer two questions: *Does this solve the actual problem?* and *Is this the right code for the job?*

We still need people who can read and review code, because someone has to judge the output. That may change in the medium or long term, but today AI-assisted development still needs a human with enough understanding to spot wrong solutions and wrong designs. The tools have compressed weeks or months of implementation into hours or days; they haven't removed the need for that oversight.

So, fellow and aspiring developers, please keep building. Keep learning.
