# ...and it was glorious!

I bombed an interview and, like the title says, it was glorious

Previously, I posted about not repeating year one. The hard part about that goal is you either need an external point of view or supreme self-awareness to succeed. I can look back on my early stage career as a developer and clearly see where I was repeating myself. As a manager, the picture is less clear.

A little while ago, I was being interviewed for a dev. manager role. This was round two or three in the process. It consisted of two scenario/play-acting sections where I had to give difficult feedback to a live "employee" (actor). In one scenario, I was asked to give feedback to a junior developer who was avoiding conflict. In another scenario, I was asked to give feedback to a developer who was not as senior as they viewed themselves. No, I am not great at improv/acting.

It was not going well. In fact, it was a train wreck. I knew that I was doing poorly, they knew that I was doing poorly. We wrapped up, said our thank yous, and went on with our lives. I already had a few follow-up sessions scheduled with the same company, but I knew they would get cancelled. I bowed out of the rest of the interview process gracefully.

I learned a lot about myself in those 65 minutes. I realized that I didn't have a complete language to describe how I connect with people. I didn't have the language to describe some aspects of who I am as a manager and leader. I realized that there was still some part of me that would rather be "liked" than "honest." Spoiler: honesty can be painful AND kind, but it has to come from a place of caring.

I am intentionally not mentioning who interviewed me or for which organization. That part isn't important. What may have felt like a waste of their time was a tremendous inflection point for me. This is my way of both sharing some insight and saying "thank you."

Remember that growth can come from the most interesting and unexpected places.
