# Whitepaper series

Every once in a while, I sit down to read published research papers. There are a ton of resources for finding papersand I cannot possibly enumerate all of them here. Google research, ACM, and arXiv provide access to so many great papers. The US military has put untold millions into developing leadership research and they make it freely available to citizens. Much in the same way I use Goodreads, I want to keep a personal log of the papers I read and would recommend.

I only plan to put out two to four sentences on my thoughts, leaving the paper itself for you to read.
