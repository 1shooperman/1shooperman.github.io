excerpt: Giving up a punctuation habit because readers now treat it as an AI tell.

Folks have started treating the em dash (—) as a signal that text is AI-generated. I've always liked it and used it on purpose for years. From here on, I'm dropping it so the writing doesn't get misread. Farewell, silly little line.

I'm giving up a punctuation habit because readers now treat it as an AI tell.

Goodbye em dash, we're breaking up.
