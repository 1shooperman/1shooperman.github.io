excerpt: "How I run the same career-day talk every year: history, binary, a robot game, and this time a short bit on agents and transformers. And why my youngest still comes home beaming."

Every year I volunteer for career day at my sons’ schools. I use the same structure every time, and I still enjoy it. These days only my youngest has those events; he comes home beaming and chatty, and tells me everyone loved the presentation.

I start by introducing myself and my background, then say we’re going to do a history lesson.

## History lesson

**Charles Babbage (1791–1871)** designed the first general-purpose mechanical computer (the Analytical Engine), even though it was never fully built in his lifetime. I use him to anchor the idea that “computer” used to mean a person or a machine that computed, and that the dream of automated calculation is old.

**Ada Lovelace (1815–1852)** wrote what we now call the first computer program: notes on how to use Babbage’s machine to calculate Bernoulli numbers. I stress that she saw the machine could do more than arithmetic, that it could manipulate symbols, and that programming and machinery have been tied together from the start.

**Alan Turing (1912–1954)** comes up next. I talk about the Enigma machine, what it was used for, and why breaking it mattered. I keep it age-appropriate but concrete: codes, war, and the idea that math and logic can change history.

I use **Grace Hopper (1906–1992)** to explain where the word “bug” comes from in software: the famous moth in the Harvard Mark II logbook. I tell the anecdote and show why “debugging” isn’t just a cute name; it’s a real part of how we work.

I close the history section with **Dr. Marian Croak (1955–)** and her work on Voice over IP (VoIP), the technology that turns voice into packets and back. I explain why that matters for the phones in their pockets and for the internet they use every day.

## Binary and the light switch

Next I give a short math lesson: binary from first principles to bits and bytes. The analogy is the classroom light switch. I turn it off and on and map “on” and “off” to 1 and 0, then build up to how we represent numbers and why computers use base 2. No hand-waving: actual binary place values and a couple of small examples so they see the pattern.

## The robot game

Then we play a game. I pretend to be a computer. The students have to get me from point A to point B using only: “Turn left,” “Turn right,” “Take one step.” I set up obstacles beforehand. There’s always chaos when I bump into something or pretend to get confused when several kids shout different commands at once.

I use that to transition into **algorithms**: a set of steps that get you from a starting state to a desired outcome. I stress that it’s not just “steps”; it’s doing it in a way that makes sense and doesn’t waste effort, and that programmers and computer scientists spend a lot of time thinking about that.

## This year’s addition: a bit on AI

I’ve updated the talk for 2026. I close with a short segment on AI. I define a few terms for them: **agent** (something that takes in information, decides what to do, and acts) vs. **model** (the thing that does the pattern-matching and prediction). Then I point them at a couple of foundational ideas, including the cat paper and transformer architecture, so they have hooks for later. I keep it brief and accurate: no “AI will do everything,” just enough so the words mean something when they hear them again.

## Questions

The whole time I encourage questions and answer anything I can. I don’t dodge the hard ones; I say when I don’t know and when something is still an open question.
